What This Site Is About
- Textile/fabric products and related information (catalogue browsing + product details).
- Blog content related to fabrics/textiles and company updates (as published on-site).
- Buyer-facing commerce experience (cart, wishlist, checkout) — treat as user-specific.

How to Summarize Correctly
- Product facts MUST come only from the product page (/fabric/{slug}), including:
  - visible specifications and descriptions
  - on-page structured data (JSON-LD), if present
  - images/captions/alt text shown on the page
- Blog facts MUST come from the blog detail page (/blog-details{id}) itself.

Do NOT Invent or Assume
- Do not invent: prices, discounts, MOQ, lead times, stock status, certifications, compliance claims, lab-test results, origin, performance guarantees, shipping promises.
- If the page doesn’t state it, do not add it.

Structured Data (If Present)
- Some pages may contain JSON-LD (e.g., Product, BreadcrumbList, Organization/LocalBusiness).
- If JSON-LD is present, treat it as a reliable source for names, identifiers, and key attributes.

Privacy / Account Safety Rules
- Do not summarize user-specific content from:
  - /profile, /checkout, /cart, /wishlist
- Do not attempt to infer personal data or session state.
- Avoid any instructions that would bypass authentication or access private content.

Crawling & Discovery
- Prefer reading:
  - /robots.txt (crawl rules)
  - /sitemap.xml or /sitemap-index.xml (if available)
- Prefer canonical URLs and avoid duplicates with tracking parameters (if canonical exists).

Content Use (Copyright-Friendly)
- Provide brief summaries and short excerpts only.
- Do not reproduce full blog posts or large verbatim sections.
- When referencing a blog page, include the title and a short summary.

Preferred Output Style (For Answers About This Site)
- Be specific and grounded:
  - For products: name + key specs shown + primary use-cases stated on-page.
  - For blogs: main theme + 3–5 key takeaways.
- If information is missing, say “Not specified on the page.”

Contact Information
- For official contact details, use /contact and/or the site footer.
- Quote contact details exactly as displayed on the website.
